Library for stateful and reactive programming: queues, observables, ownership
and lifetimes, procedural reactivity. Lightweight alternative to RxJS for GUI
programs.

See sibling library [`fpx`](https://mitranim.com/fpx/) for functional
programming utils.

Install with `npm` (version {{version}}):

```sh
npm i --save --save-exact espo
```

All examples imply an import:

```js
const {someFunction} = require('espo')
```
