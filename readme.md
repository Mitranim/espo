## Changelog

### 0.4.2

Bugfixed `Agent.prototype.unown` after recent changes.

### 0.4.1

Added missing "constructor" to a few prototypes.

### 0.4.0

Improved minification. Breaking.

* Code is now written with ES5-style classes to avoid Babel garbage in the output. This significantly reduces the amount of transpiled code and makes it much nicer to read.

* In the transpiled version, classes don't have IIFEs anymore, which means they're not stripped away by dead code elimination due to side-effectful prototype mutations. This turns out to be a benefit, since it further reduces the size, while DCE, realistically, tends to not work in real-world application bundles.

* Mangle all properties in all classes, except `.state` and `.states`. This reduces the API surface and chances of confusion, and greatly reduces the minified size.

* Aliased `.deref()` as `.$` (a getter) in all classes that implement `isObservableRef`. In addition, aliased `.deref` as `.$` (same method) in `Reaction`. This works with ES2015 destructuring, saves a lot of typing, and minifies a lot better, at the cost of lower readability.

* Added `Que.prototype.has` (tentative).

TLDR: Espo went from ≈10 KiB to ≈8 KiB, while slimming down the API surface and providing the nice `$` shortcuts.

### 0.3.3

Better compatibility with minification.

  * in the transpiled version, annotate class IIFEs with `#__PURE__`

  * don't assign to prototypes outside the autogenerated IIFEs

  * in combination with tree shaking, this finally allows UglifyJS to remove unused classes
